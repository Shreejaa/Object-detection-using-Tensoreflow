#### INTRODUCTION
The vehicle loaded with material is detected by Object detection - the process of finding real-world object instances like car, bike, 
TV, flowers, and humans in still images or Videos shown in Figure1. It allows for the recognition, localization, and detection of 
multiple objects within an image which provides us with a much better understanding of an image as a whole. It is commonly 
used in applications such as image retrieval, security, surveillance, and advanced driver assistance systems that can be 
implemented using Deep Neural network with supervised learning via Tensorflow library11: Tensorflow is Googleâ€™s Open Source 
Machine Learning Framework for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical 
operations, while the graph edges represent the multi-dimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. Tensors are 
just multidimensional arrays, an extension of 2-dimensional tables to data with a higher dimension. There are many features of 
Tensorflow which makes it appropriate for Deep Learning.
